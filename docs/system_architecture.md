# System Architecture

The Friend Advisor Score (FAST) system is designed with a modular architecture, leveraging various technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and security. The system is composed of several components, each responsible for a specific functionality.

## Overview

The system is divided into the following main components:

1. **Database**: Handles all data storage and retrieval operations.
2. **Blockchain**: Manages user identity and ensures data security.
3. **AI/ML Model**: Responsible for analyzing and scoring users' online presence.
4. **Score Update**: Handles real-time updating of user scores.
5. **Authentication**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
6. **API**: Provides endpoints for integration with third-party platforms.
7. **Frontend**: User interface for accessing and understanding FAST scores.

## Detailed Architecture

### Database (`database.py`)

The database component uses PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. It uses a connection pool to manage database connections, ensuring optimal performance even under high load. The `Database` class provides methods for executing and fetching queries.

### Blockchain (`blockchain.py`)

The blockchain component uses the Web3 library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides methods for checking the connection status, getting the balance, and sending transactions. User scores are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

### AI/ML Model (`ai_model.py`)

The AI/ML model component uses PyTorch to implement the Social Authenticity Model. This model analyzes various factors such as social media activity, communication patterns, and overall digital behavior to calculate a user's FAST score.

### Score Update (`score_update.py`)

The score update component is responsible for real-time updating of user scores. It uses the AI/ML model to calculate scores based on users' ongoing online activities.

### Authentication (`auth.py`)

The authentication component uses the JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication and authorization. It provides methods for user registration, login, and token verification.

### API (`api.py`)

The API component provides endpoints for third-party platforms to integrate with the FAST system. It uses Flask-RESTful for creating RESTful APIs.

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

The frontend component uses React to create a user-friendly interface. It provides pages for home, user profile, and score view.

## Configuration (`config.py`)

The system uses environment variables for configuration, ensuring flexibility and security. The `config.py` file loads these variables and provides them to other components.

## Security Measures

The system implements robust security measures to protect user data. It uses HTTPS for secure communication, JWT for user authentication, and stores user scores on the blockchain for transparency and security. The system also follows best practices for user authentication and authorization, and regularly updates dependencies and conducts security audits.

## Scalability and Performance

The system is designed with scalability in mind to accommodate a growing user base. It uses a connection pool for efficient database connection management, and implements efficient algorithms for real-time score updates. The system also optimizes performance for quick and responsive score calculations.
